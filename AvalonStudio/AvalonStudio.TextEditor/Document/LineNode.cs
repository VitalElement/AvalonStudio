		// optimization note: I tried packing color and isDeleted into a single byte field, but that

		// into a single DWORD, but two bytes get each their own DWORD. Three bytes end up in the same DWORD, so
		// apparently the JIT only optimizes for memory when there are at least three small fields.
		// Currently, DocumentLine takes 36 bytes on x86 (8 byte object overhead, 3 pointers, 3 ints, and another DWORD
		// for the small fields).
		// TODO: a possible optimization would be to combine 'totalLength' and the small fields into a single uint.
		// delimiterSize takes only two bits, the two bools take another two bits; so there's still 
		// 28 bits left for totalLength. 268435455 characters per line should be enough for everyone :)
