  * @date    11-March-2015
  * @brief   This file provides a set of functions needed to manage an I2C M24LR64 
  *          EEPROM memory.
  *          To be able to use this driver, the switch EE_M24LR64 must be defined
  *          in your toolchain compiler preprocessor
  *          
  *          =================================================================== 
  *          Notes:
  *           - This driver is intended for STM32F4xx families devices only. 
  *           - The I2C EEPROM memory (M24LR64) is available on separate daughter 
  *             board ANT7-M24LR-A, which is not provided with the STM32446E_EVAL
  *             board.
  *             To use this driver you have to connect the ANT7-M24LR-A to CN3 
  *             connector of STM32446E_EVAL board.
  *          ===================================================================
  *              
  *          It implements a high level communication layer for read and write 
  *          from/to this memory. The needed STM32F4xx hardware resources (I2C and 
  *          GPIO) are defined in stm32446e_eval.h file, and the initialization is
  *          performed in EEPROM_IO_Init() function declared in stm32446e_eval.c
  *          file.
  *          You can easily tailor this driver to any other development board, 
  *          by just adapting the defines for hardware resources and 
  *          EEPROM_IO_Init() function. 
  *        
  *          @note In this driver, basic read and write functions (BSP_EEPROM_ReadBuffer() 
  *                and BSP_EEPROM_WritePage()) use DMA mode to perform the data 
  *                transfer to/from EEPROM memory.
  *
  *         @note   Regarding BSP_EEPROM_WritePage(), it is a optimized function to perform
  *                small write (less than 1 page) BUT The number of bytes (combined to write start address) must not 
  *                cross the EEPROM page boundary. This function can only write into
  *                the boundaries of an EEPROM page.
  *                This function doesn't check on boundaries condition (in this driver 
  *                the function BSP_EEPROM_WriteBuffer() which calls BSP_EEPROM_WritePage() is 
  *                responsible of checking on Page boundaries).
