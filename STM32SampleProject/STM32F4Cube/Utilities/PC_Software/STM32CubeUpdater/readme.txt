The STM32CubeF4 firmware package comes with an updater utility: STM32CubeUpdater, 
also available as a menu within STM32CubeMX code generation tool.
The updater solution detects new firmware releases and patches available from st.com and 
proposes to download them to the user’s computer.

How to install and run the STM32CubeUpdater program
  o Double-click SetupSTM32CubeUpdater.exe file to launch the installation.
  o Accept the license terms and follow the different installation steps.
  o Upon successful installation, STM32CubeUpdater becomes available as an 
    STMicroelectronics program under Program Files and is automatically launched.
  o The STM32CubeUpdater icon appears in the system tray: right-click the updater
    icon and select Updater Settings to configure the Updater connection and whether
    to perform manual or automatic checks (see STM32CubeMX User guide - UM1718 section 3 -
